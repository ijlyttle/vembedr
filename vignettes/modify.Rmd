This article deals with modifications you can make to videos that you embed. These include:

- start time
- horizontal alignment
- rounded corners
- responsive sizing for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/components/#responsive-embed)

These modifications can be made independently of each other, and can be composed:

```{r}
embed_youtube("2WoDQBhJCVQ") %>%
  use_start_time("44s") %>%
  use_align("center") %>%
  use_rounded(10)
```

To embed videos from variety of services, please read `vignette("embed")`. 

## Start time

To specify a starting time for a video, you can `use_start_time()`: 

```{r}
embed_youtube(id = "8SGif63VW6E") %>% 
  use_start_time("4m12s")
```

Thanks to [AurÃ©lien Ginolhac](https://github.com/ginolhac) for suggesting this video using this start-time.

The `use_start_time()` function treats these all of these inputs equivalently:

- `"0h1m0s"`, `"0h01m00s"`, `"0h1m"`
- `"1m0s"`, `"1m"`
- `"60s"`, `60`

This function works with all of the services except for Box. 

## Horizontal alignment

You can `use_align()` to specify the horizontal alignment:

```{r}
embed_vimeo("10022924") %>%
  use_align("center")
```

Possible values for `align` are: `"left"` (default), `"right"`, `"center"`, `"justified"`. 

## Rounded corners
 
You can `use_rounded()` to specify the `radius` (in pixels) of the rounds:

```{r}
embed_youtube("lan-UQfN0zs") %>%
  use_rounded(radius = 10)
```

This seems to work better in the browser than in the RStudio viewer.

## Responsive sizing

If you are using Bootstrap, you can `use_bs_responsive()` to make your video responsive to the width of its container:

```{r}
embed_youtube("FkBQc0gQkQI") %>%
  use_bs_responsive()
```

It has no arguments, but it uses the `ratio` provided to the `embed()` function:

```{r}
embed_youtube("KvX8MijgeW8", ratio = "4by3") %>%
  use_bs_responsive()  
```

The `ratio` defaults to `"16by9"`, but it can also be `"4by3"`.

If you are viewing this as this HTML vignette provided by R's help, you will not see responsiveness as it does not use Bootstrap. 

If you are viewing this at [this package's pkgdown site](https://ijlyttle.github.io/vembedr/articles/modify.html), you will see the responsiveness.
