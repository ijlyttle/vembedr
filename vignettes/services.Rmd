The foundation of this package is the `embed()` family of functions, used to generate the embed code from a supported service. Often, parameters are specified in the embed code using the *query* and *fragment* components of the reference URL. The query/fragment parameters for each service can be found at:

- [YouTube IFrame API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters)
- [Vimeo emebedding](https://developer.vimeo.com/player/embedding)
- [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Forty-years-of-S), which includes the UseR! 2016 and 2017 videos. Click the *Embed* tab for emdedding options.
- [Box](https://developer.box.com/docs/box-embed#section-build-box-embed-programatically)

One of the goals of this package is to make it easier to specify the important parameters: video-identifier and (optional) start-time. This vignette deals with how to obtain video-identifiers, the *helpers* vignette deals with how to set the start-time.

Each of the services exposes `height` and `width` arguments; each of the `embed()` functions has these arguments. The defaults for each service are taken from that service's default values. 

If this package does not contain the customization you need, keep in mind that the the ouput of an `embed()` function is simply an HMTL tag that can be modified using functions from the **htmltools** package. 

```{r}
library("htmltools")
library("vembedr")
```

For example, to center your video horizontally, you can pipe to the function `use_align()`:

```{r}
rickroll_youtube() %>%
  use_align("center")
```

You can make things responsive:

```{r}
embed_youtube("zpOULjyy-n8") %>%
  use_bs_responsive()
```

You can make rounded corners:

```{r}
rickroll_youtube() %>%
  use_rounded()
```

```{r}
rickroll_youtube() %>%
  use_align("center") %>%
  use_rounded(radius = 5)
```


```{r}
embed_youtube("zpOULjyy-n8") %>%
  use_bs_responsive() %>%
  use_rounded()
```

## YouTube

You can get your video's identifier by inspecting its URL at YouTube. Consider this YouTube URL:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tags$p(
  tags$code(
    HTML(paste0("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=", tags$strong("44wDwMQVqCc")))
  )  
)
```

The identifier is simply the last part of the URL: **`44wDwMQVqCc`**. 

To embed this video, use the function `embed_youtube()`, using the identifier as the `id` argument:

```{r}
embed_youtube(id = "44wDwMQVqCc")
```

## Vimeo

For Vimeo, the identifier is also included in the standard URL:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tags$p(
  tags$code(
    HTML(paste0("https://vimeo.com/", tags$strong("238200347")))
  )  
)
```

The Vimeo identifier is just the path part of the URL: **`238200347`**:

```{r}
embed_vimeo(id = "238200347")
```

## Box

To share a video on Box, the video file itself will have to be shared. From the Box web-interface, you can do this by clicking the **Share** button at the top-right corner of your file's web-page. 

Then, you need to capture some infomation about the embed-link itself, either the URL or the `id`.

![Box Share](figures/box-url.png){ width=100% }

Please note that you need to provide the `id` from the "ugly" URL, not a custom URL.  

```{r}
embed_url("https://app.box.com/s/m5do45hvzw32iv2aors3urf5pgkxxazx")
```

You can do the same thing using the `embed_box()` function and the `id`. The Box identifier is  the path part of the URL that follows the `s/`, in this case: **`m5do45hvzw32iv2aors3urf5pgkxxazx`**.


```{r eval=FALSE}
embed_box(id = "m5do45hvzw32iv2aors3urf5pgkxxazx")
```

If you are using a corporate instance of Box, and use the `embed_box()` function, you will also have to specify the `custom_domain`. For example, if your URL starts with `"https://acme.app.box.com"`, then your `custom_domain` is `"acme"`.



## UseR!2016 (and 2017)

One of the great things about the useR! 2016 conference was that all of the keynotes and contributed talks were recorded, thanks to Microsoft. The videos are available on Microsoft's Channel 9 service - so it behooves us to make an function to embed Channel 9 videos.

Consider Rick Becker's talk on the history of the S language. Seriously, consider it - now, if you have not already seen it:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tags$p(
  tags$code(
    HTML(paste0(
      "https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/",  
      tags$strong("Forty-years-of-S")
    ))
  )  
)
```

For a UseR!2016 (or 2017) video, the identifier is the last component of path of the URL, in this case: **`Forty-years-of-S`**. To embed the video:

```{r}
embed_user2016(id = "Forty-years-of-S")
```

## Channel 9

The UseR! 2016 ans 2017 videos are hosted on Microsoft's Channel 9 service, so an embed function is provided to use it.

Personal note: one of the things I want to well-and-truly understand (along with non-standard evaluation) is monads. I understand it to be a useful construct for managing side-effects, but true understanding escapes me. This is a great video; it gets me 95% of the way there (I think), so maybe repeated viewings will get me sufficiently close.

Here's the URL:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tags$p(
  tags$code(
    HTML(paste0(
      "https://channel9.msdn.com/",  
      tags$strong("Shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-Dont-fear-the-Monads")
    ))
  )  
)
```

The identifier is the path of the URL, **`Shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-Dont-fear-the-Monads`**, which you can express as a string:

```{r}
embed_channel9(id = "Shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-Dont-fear-the-Monads")
```

Alternatively, you can express this as a vector of strings:

```{r eval=FALSE}
embed_channel9(
  id = c("Shows", "Going+Deep", "Brian-Beckman-Dont-fear-the-Monads")
)
```
